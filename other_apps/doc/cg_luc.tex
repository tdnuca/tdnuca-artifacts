    References input sets            & Matrix-dependent (See README for matrices). 4 parameters are important: the number of rows ($n$), non-zeroes ($nnz$), iterations ($it$) and blocks ($b$, usually equal to number of threads).
    Total size is $60 n + 12 nnz$ bytes, 8 different task types, $it \times (2 + 6 b)$ total tasks. Task complexity (total per task type per iteration) in number of floating point operations is: negligible (2 task types), $O(n)$ (5 task types), $O(nnz)$ (1 task type). Every 50 iterations, two supplementary task types are used (complexity $O(nnz)$ and $O(n)$ respectively, $b$ blocks per task type). \\
    Scalability                      & Matrix-dependent \\
    Additional notes                 & Due to task execution/creation overlapping, enabling require nanos newer than 16.06 release: version at least Jul 05, 2016 (commit 7680b4c). A fallback reduction is available using atomic concurrent accesses. This is the same code as the MPI+OmpSs CG, with mpi support disabled. \\
