    Programming model                & MPI+OpenMP (but compiled with OmpSs, because Tasksim does not support OpenMP) \\
    Dependences                      & No dependences \\
    Synchronization                  & Barriers / Reductions / Atomics / Critical sections \\
    Special OmpSs annotations        & No \\
    Additional features              & None \\
    OpenMP implementation available? & Yes and working \\
    References input sets            & 10M elements, scales up to 1024 cores at least. Depending on number of cores, takes between 10 seconds and 2 minutes per iteration. There's also two very small tests, only useful to test if it's working at all \\
    Scalability                      & Scales almost linearly up to 512 cores, scales well with 1024 cores too. \\
