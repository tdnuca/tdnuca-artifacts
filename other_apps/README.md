# Parallel applications

Collection of parallel applications to be used in our experiments (simulators and native runs).

This current list is from applications has been compiled from different sources. We should also look at the HCA-apps and the former MontBlanc benchmarks. In addition it might also be interesting to have pure OpenMP applications (preferably that work well with dynamic scheduling) and hybrid applications (i.e., MPI+OpenMP and MPI+OmpSs).

## Application descriptions
We should maintain a table with general information for each application in the repository, so we can quickly identify applications that suite our needs. The table can be found in the `doc` folder as a latex file.

## Per-application usage file
Please look at the USAGE.md file inside each application folder for instructions on how to compile, run and other relevant information. There is a USAGE-TEMPLATE.md file in the root folder, so please if you are familiar with an application that does not have a USAGE.md file add it.
