== Description ==
The integral histogram computes a cumulative histogram for each pixel of an image. With this measure one 
can find the histogram of a Cartesian region of pixels in constant time. Morphology and thresholding 
are two examples of operations in digital image processing that repeatedly compute histograms on the same 
input image and hence benefit from the integral histogram. This package describes the cross-weave scan. 

=== Origin ===
Written from scratch based on the description in "Integral Histogram: A Fast Way To Extract Histograms in Cartesian Spaces" 
by Fatih Porikli (2005). 

=== General Algorithm ===
The algorithm initializes each pixel with an empty histogram. The number of bins and the size of a bin 
are input parameters. The application computes the cumulative histogram at a pixel (i,j) in two passes over the 
blocks of the input image. The horizontal pass processes the image blocks and propagates the histograms from (i,j) to (i,j+1) 
The vertical pass propagates the histograms from (i,j) to (i+1,j). 

=== Execution instructions ===
./inthist imw imh bw bh bins binstride it otsuheight otsuwidth [[BR]]
* imw       = image width in pixels
* imh       = image height in pixels
* bw        = width of a block in pixels
* bh        = height of a block in pixels
* bins      = number of bins in a histogram
* binstride = bin width
To check the results for correctness edit inthist_check.h and set INTHIST_CHECK to a value greater than 0. 
The integral histogram can be compiled with OpenCV support to process images.
