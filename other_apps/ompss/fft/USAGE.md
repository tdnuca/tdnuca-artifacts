# Fast Fourier Transform

## Issues
Current task granularity might not be optimal.

## Compilation instructions
Use any of the targets (perf, instr, debug, seq) to build the corresponding executable, e.g. `make perf` will build the default ompss executable.

## Running instructions
Pick between 1 and 3 dimensions and run: `./fft dim1 dim2 dim3`. One dimension will run a 1D fft, 2 a 2D fft, and 3 a 3D fft.
Use the `-r` flag  to check the results against the reference (sequential) implementation.
Use the `-p` flag  to check the results against `numpy.fft.fftn()`, which requires python3 with numpy installed (and probably won't work for too big input sizes).


## Inputs
Inputs are generated randomly using a Lehmer RNG. Use the `-s` flag to change the seed.

## Additional information
Example running a 2D case for a 2K x 64K grid (solve time is reported in micro seconds):

- The task granularity is rather small currently, as that is what I required.
  Currently in 2D the number of tasks is proportional to dim1 * log2(dim2), the task size is roughly dim2 / 2.
  This means results will scale with the 2nd dimension and overheads will increase more when changing the first dimension.
  I found 64K in dim2 to be reasonable for 4 threads.
- Task dependencies can be changed, in particular for multiple dimension cases tasks can be grouped for several rows together or nested from one dimension to the next.
- For scaling results, the baseline should probably be code from seq.c, as it is just the legacy code modernized but not parallelized yet.
